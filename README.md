# pianochord

This is a keyboard web app.

# How to run
Because this app uses CORS request for the audio files, we must put the files inside a webserver.

If you are using apache, put the files inside public_html/htdocs.

If you are using python, open terminal and cd to the directory, run "python -m http.server" or "python -m SimpleHTTPServer".

If you are too lazy for that, just go to http://chorductor.com

Thank you!
